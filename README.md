## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aask42/NameGrid.git
cd NameGrid
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install required fonts (or provide your own):
   - Download and install `Dyslexie_Bold_142436.ttf` (dyslexia-friendly font)
   - Download and install `fantasy-zone.ttf` (decorative font for year display)
   - Place font files in the project directory or update paths in [`generate.py`](generate.py:16)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Edit the `nametag_names` list in [`generate.py`](generate.py:157) with your participant data:
```python
nametag_names = [
    {"name": "John Doe", "Role": "Software Engineer", "Tagline_Mod": "Innovation Team"},
    {"name": "Jane Smith", "Role": "Project Manager", "Tagline_Mod": "Leadership Excellence"},
    # Add more participants...
]
```

2. Update the year and logo path:
```python
year = "2025"
logo_path = "your_logo.png"
```

3. Run the generator:
```python
python generate.py
```

4. The script will create `nametags.pdf` in the current directory.

### Customization Options

#### Font Configuration
- **Primary Font** ([`font_1`](generate.py:13)): Used for names, roles, and taglines
- **Decorative Font** ([`font_2`](generate.py:14)): Used for year display

#### Layout Settings
- **Nametag Size**: 3.4" × 3.4" squares
- **Page Layout**: 2 columns × 3 rows (6 nametags per page)
- **Margins**: 5mm from page edges
- Update to your preferred dimensions in [`generate.py`](generate.py:20-21)

#### Logo Placement
- **Watermark**: Large, rotated, semi-transparent background logo
- **Corner Logo**: Small logo in bottom-right corner of each nametag

## File Structure

```
NameGrid/
├── generate.py              # Main nametag generator script
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
├── README.md               # This file
├── logoold.png             # Default logo file
├── Dyslexie_Bold_142436.ttf # Accessibility font (not included)
├── fantasy-zone.ttf        # Decorative font (not included)
└── nametags.pdf            # Generated output (created after running)
```

## Configuration

### Data Format

Each nametag entry requires three fields:
- `name`: Participant's full name
- `Role`: Job title, organization, or role
- `Tagline_Mod`: Event name, department, or custom tagline

### Font Requirements

The script requires two TrueType fonts which you can change as needed:
1. **Dyslexie Bold**: Accessibility-focused font for main text
2. **Fantasy Zone**: Decorative font for year display

Update font paths in [`generate.py`](generate.py:16-17) if fonts are located elsewhere.

### Logo Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency support recommended
- **Size**: Scalable (automatically resized)
- **Placement**: Update `logo_path` variable in [`generate.py`](generate.py:183)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Font Not Found Error**
   - Ensure font files are in the correct location
   - Update font paths in the script
   - Install fonts system-wide if needed

2. **Logo Not Displaying**
   - Verify logo file path and format
   - Ensure PNG files have proper transparency
   - Check file permissions

3. **Text Overflow**
   - The script automatically adjusts font sizes
   - Very long names/roles may still overflow
   - Consider abbreviating extremely long text

### Performance Notes

- Large batches (100+ nametags) may take several seconds to generate
- High-resolution logos will increase file size and processing time
- PDF output is optimized for printing at 300 DPI
